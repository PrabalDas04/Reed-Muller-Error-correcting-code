## Project title
Reed-Muller Encoding and Error correction Scheme.

## Description
1. Reed-Muller code is used for errror correction of a codeword.
2. In this program I did an encoding of an message, error mixing with certain probability and decoding of a codeword.
3. After running the program, it will ask for an message input which it will encode.
4. Then it will ask for an error probabilty, p, in which the bit flip error can happen in the channel.
5. Then it will show the erroneous codeword and the correct decoding of the codeword.
6. If the no. of bit flip exceeds certain range(In which Reed_Muller can correct), it will pop up an ERROR message.
